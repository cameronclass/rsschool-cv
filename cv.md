## About Me:
I have been working in web development for 5 years. I have experience working in a web studio for 1 year, completed many freelance orders, and I am currently working at a company specializing in transporting goods from China to Russia (website: [wisetao.com](https://wisetao.com)). I have been responsible for the layout and maintenance of this site for a year. Additionally, I also create websites on a freelance basis.

I have always been interested in working remotely on a computer, as well as programming and writing code. Optimizing my life through programming is a key motivation for me.

I have developed the mindset that nothing is impossible and always complete any assigned task regardless of the circumstances.
